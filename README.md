# face-recognition
ResNet-50 models are implemented, retrained with loss functions Triplet Loss, N-pair Loss, SphereFace Loss, ArcFace Loss. Protection methods are implemented: training with adversarial images, transformation of input data using an autoencoder (with the option of joint training of an autoencoder and a ResNet-50 model), transformation of output data using the PCA algorithm.
